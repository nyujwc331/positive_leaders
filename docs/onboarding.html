<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8pt; ">
<i><code>Irene Nizzero, MCP 236, April 1, 2020 @ 4 PM - 5:30 PM</code></i>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 16pt; ">
<b>Purpose of call</b>
</p>
<p><i>We will use the time to hear what you are working on, to answer your questions, to give you a chance to get to know me, and to get a feel for what working with me might be like.</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The initial conversation, being the very first contact with the potential client before they enlist you as a coach. Together the coach and the client are going to decide if this relationship is going to go forward, and what it is going to look like. That is the objective of this very first conversation. Understanding if coaching what they want and whether you are a good fit, both of which are, according to the code of ethics and the ICF, important elements in establishing this coaching relationship. This is required ethically. If I am talking to a potential client and I don’t know if coaching is really going to serve you, I am the best person to serve you, I will say that up front.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b> The key here is to let the client do most of the talking – coach uses occasional questions to get more information and create awareness.</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 16pt; ">
<b>Why are you looking for a coach?</b>
</p>
<p><i>Do a short coaching session to get an understanding of their agenda.
Get a sense of whether they have <u>coachable issues</u>, <u>willing to put in work</u>, <u>fit</u>. </i></p>
<ul>
<li>Goals and ambitions</li>
<li>Values</li>
<li>What matters in their life?</li>
<li>Where do you see yourself in 5 years or have you given thought to where you would like to be in 5 years?</li>
<li>What are you looking for in a coach or how do you want to be coached?</li>
<li>What are your top three fears about having this relationship with someoe you do not know?</li>
<li>What would be a measure of success for them?</li>
<li>What obstacles prevent them from moving forward?</li>
<li>Describe that for me.</li>
<li>What do you mean when you say …?</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 16pt; ">
<b>What do you know about coaching already?</b>
</p>
<p><i>Get a sense of whether they have <u>experience with coaching</u>, <u>their understanding</u>, <u>gaps in knowledge</u>.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 16pt; ">
<b>Tell me a story of you at your best.</b>
</p>
<p><i>Identify their stregngths or values.</u>.</i>
Have them talk about a time when they were at their bestand inevitably some of their strengths will come through. And, the strengths don’t have to be VIA strengths. In that first session hear a little bit about what the client wants, learn about them and then use that information to identify strengths or values.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 16pt; ">
<b>Share about your coaching style.</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Client expectations</b></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Client is in the driver’s seat and is responsible ultimately where the coaching goes. They are responsible for bringing an agenda to each coaching session. <mark>Clients set the agenda, and brings something workable for a small session.</mark> Help them understand that coaches are looking for a <u>strategy, technique, tip or an idea, coping mechanisms,affirmation</u> that will help when client solve their problems. Client defines success. <mark>We need the sign post</mark> at the end of this session that signal for us when we are done and that we have achieved the agenda. During these sessions I will ask powerful questions to help increase your self awareness to help you achieve the potential that you know you are capable of but can’t quite get to alone.</p></li>
<li><p><u>What I ask of you is: </u></p>
<ul>
<li>100% committed, prepared, and focused during our sessions.</li>
<li><mark>100% honesty and transparency.</mark>
<ul>
<li>Tell the coach if something the coach says upsets them, is off the mark, or lands badly.</li>
<li>Let the coach know when the client needs more pushing or less.</li>
<li>Tell me if the coaching is NOT working, and why.</li>
<li>Tell me if it is something you do NOT want to talk about.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><b>Coach expectations</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Per ICF training, <mark>coaches consider our clients whole, resourceful, and creative</mark></li>
<li>We will NOT
<ul>
<li><mark>Give you the answers. I am here to help you discover what is important to you NOT and what solutions work for you.</mark></li>
<li>Judge, be attached to being right, or care about anything beyond whatever it means to you. If you are disappointed and wish it could be different then that is something that we can talk about and work on. I want you to be yourself and I am here just walking along with you.</li>
<li>I will ask you about accountability but I will not necessarily require it of you on any level. It is completely up to you.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We will DO
<ul>
<li>Ask sometimes hard or <mark>painful powerful questions.</mark></li>
<li>Create deeper <mark>awareness</mark> with the client.</li>
<li>Push you to stretch limits and take risks.</li>
<li><mark>Hold you to your agenda.</mark></li>
<li>Be overjoyed and celebrate client successes.
<br></br></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><b>Confidentiality</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Today and if we do go forward it is held confidential.</li>
<li><mark>Exceptions to confidentiality</mark>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If you are at risk of hurting yourself or someone else, I am obligated to share that information with someone who could intervene on your behalf.</li>
<li>Law supersedes the coaching code of ethics. If I were called to speak to a legal authority, I would have no choice but to provide your information.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>You are at liberty to say what you want about your coaching. We are not held to the same standard.
<br></br></li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Clarification of coachable topics</b>
<ul>
<li>Do you know the <mark>difference between therapy and coaching?</mark>
<ul>
<li>I am not here to give you answers, advice, or medical diagnoses, etc.</li>
<li><mark>I am not fixing anything from a therapeutic standpoint</mark> such as emotions or a longstanding problem that you have had historically since your childhood.
<ul>
<li>It is not to suggest that we don’t talk about feelings or issues related to feelings, it’s just that they are not things that we are trying to fix. We are trying to work towards behavioral change that will lead you to the success that you are looking for. For example, if you had to talk to your boss and you were anxious about it, it is not as though we wouldn’t talk about feelings, they are not the primary focus. Our primary focus is that you need to talk to your boss and what can we do to help you do that in a way that suits you as an individual. It is about getting to that goal that you are working towards more than focusing on emotion. Emotion is more likely the content of a therapy or counseling session.</li>
<li>We don’t spend a lot of time in the past, unless they somehow inform patterns that we are seeing so providing an awareness might be helpful. For example, what do we need to know about that that will help us create a plan for getting past that point.
<br></br></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Coaching Concepts</b>
<ul>
<li><mark>Inner critic</mark>
<ul>
<li>An inner critic, it’s that voice that tells you all the things about you that you CAN’T do, have, or be. The purpose of the inner critic, at its core, is to try and prevent you from falling on your face. It doesn’t want you to blow it like a fool. It usually has good intentions but at the same time the inner critic is quite often a liar.<br />
</li>
<li>Everyone on the planet has an inner critic to some extent. The people that you see walking around who are very confident, solid, intentional, calm, unflustered, full of themselves have just learned to manage their inner critic very well. Together we will address this inner critic and I will provide ways to manage it.</li>
<li>For example, I may ask you to create a physical representation of your critic that can be placed in a drawer, left in the glove box of your car before an important meeting, or even stashed in the freezer. This physical action will help you set aside the critic’s voice.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><mark>Permission</mark>
<ul>
<li>I might ask permission before I offer a suggestion or an activity.</li>
<li>Don’t be surprised by that, because as your coach I am here to help you discover what is important to you NOT give you the answers or suggestions or tell you what you should do. I may ask permission to share something with you that I think might be relevant, NOT the answer, but relevant to what we are talking about. In which case I might actually take my coaching hat off for a second and say I am going to step out of my role and offer a suggestion.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Clearing
<ul>
<li>There will be times when you come to a session frustrated or bothered by something that happened that is distracting you from focusing on the coaching call, I’ll give you a brief opportunity to vent for 2 minutes. I won’t ask questions or give feedback. I’ll just listen without judging for that short length of time so you can let it out and get ready to focus on the session.</li>
<li>When two minutes is up, we will stop and see how you feel.</li>
<li>If you can’t get all that stuff out, all your distractions in your head before we start coaching, coaching isn’t going to work.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><mark>Bottom lining</mark>
<ul>
<li>Part of my role is to keep you focused and make sure our time together is productive. We want coaching to be effective, helpful use of your time and the clients, but theirs most of all. However, it is very common and a part of human nature that sometimes we get off on a tangent. If you go into a lot of detail or start telling a long story, or go into story mode, I will do something that sounds like I am interrupting, to keep you focused on the agenda and moving forward. I apologize for seeming rude, but you are paying for my services and if we start to be veering off track, I am going to try and make sure that I bring us back. That will be part of my job as well and I apologize up front if that sounds intrusive or rude. I will ask say to you, so help me understand how this is related to what you brought as an agenda, or what is the really important piece of this that is going to help me understand your agenda.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I hear that this is really important to you and it sounds like a level of detail that matters a lot, and for the sake of us using your time to the best of your ability, I am going to ask you what is the most crucial element out of this story that you want to know.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>Brainstorming
<ul>
<li>It is a way to help people come up with options. In brainstorming, the client comes up with an idea and I come up with an idea, and we kind of bounce off of each other. This is a possibility that things will happen that don’t look like the coaching that you described.

<b>Different Approaches for Initial Coaching Conversation</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Skip long introductions and communicate this information in pieces over time</li>
<li>Use four or five key questions that are important to the coaching and send them to the client in advance of the first conversation for the client to answer in writing before the session or to answer during the session</li>
<li>Use a “Welcome Pack” that includes all the necessary information and go over the information with the client either during the first session or pieces over time</li>
<li>Use a specifically structured template for the first session</li>
<li>Schedule a longer session so the coach can communicate this necessary information and also conduct the first coaching session</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Hours for ICF</i> - This initial conversation is still logged even though you aren’t getting paid because you are establishing a coaching relationship. If you don’t go further with that client then it is considered a pro bono hour. If you do secure that person as a client, that hour counts as a paid hour and is considered rolled into the fees that you charge them.</p>

<i><code>Irene Nizzero, MCP 236, April 15, 2020 @ 4 PM - 5:30 PM</code></i>
</p>
<p>The first conversation with a potential client is an intake call, if you can meet with the client for ~ 1 hr. you can combine the intake and inital call (i.e. known as a complementary coaching session ~30-45 minutes). Irene usually ends up combining these two.</p>
<p>The complementary or introduction coaching session is to give clients a sense of what it would be like to be in a coaching conversation and it can occur on a seperate date. Give a hint in that intake session that in the complimentary session, to bring something that is on their mind currently. And, in the intake session you will have talked about how the topics for each session have to be bite size to do within the span of whatever our coaching session length is.</p>
<p><b>In the intake and complementary session, you are trying to peak their interest by pointing out that there are lots of things that people don’t realize get into their own way- like blind spots, ways of thinking that are barriers to their own success. A coaches helps eliminate those barriers and potential blind spots and to help people work with them. Chances are you know what you need to do, you are just not able to access that information in the moment, so I am going to ask you a lot of questions to help unearth that.</b></p>
<p>Imagine that you were looking for a coach and think what would you be wondering about, maybe even worried about as you are trying to find a coach or figure out the coaching process. These types of concerns should be addressed during the intake session and/or the complimentary session.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>It is a really good question to ask to how would you like to be coached</b></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>9:10 people will say I have no idea, especially if they have never worked with a coach before. You can provide them with an example. If I was looking for a coach, I would want them to be very honest with me even if it felt like wow that is a very hard pill to swallow. That is the only thing that is going to help me progress, but not everyone likes that.That at least gives something of a marker or a benchmark kind of thing for a person to gauge against.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><b>Determine the client’s agenda</b>
<ul>
<li>What do they want to work on with you?</li>
<li>What do they want to accomplish in this short session?</li>
<li>What would be a measure of success for them?</li>
<li>What makes their agenda important to them?</li>
<li>What impact will meeting their agenda create for them?</li>
<li>What obstacles prevent them form moving forward?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b> Let the client do most of the talking</b></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>You want to do as much as you can to deepen that potential client’s awareness about the issue at hand. Using standard questions of why is this important to you, or what is getting in the way of you being able to do this.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><b>You are also doing your best to hear and reflect back what you are hearing</b></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I cannot overstate how important it is to ensure that you are hearing the person correctly and checking in to be sure that is the case, especially in that preliminary session. Asking Did I get that right; if I may what I just heard you say was this. How does that land with you or how did I do in understanding and replaying what I have heard from you.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><b>Becareful about giving feedback on your session</b></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>You can say things like - yes, I think this is a coachable topic. I think this is something that coaching could support. We never ever want to promise anything. You can say that you can can support them or make that effort to help them through. I really feel like what you are bringing to the coaching situation is very appropriate for coaching. It is not a matter of I promise you that I can do this, but more of this is a topic that would fit within the coaching conversation.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer service is paramount</b></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Every so often you want to give people greater value than you bargained for and that in the case of coaching may come in the form of time. There is merit to going above and beyond, the recommendation is since you are allowing 30 minutes, especially if it is separate, give yourself 45 minutes. You might be thinking does that set me up to appear, either disinterested in following time, boundaries, or maybe disrespecting their time. No, especially if you comment about.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We went a little over today, generally speaking though I will be punctual about wrapping up our appointments mostly because I want to respect your time as much as mine.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><b>Confirming the coaching relationship</b></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Ann Durand, never lets a person decide on the spot if they want to move forward. She makes them go away and think about that it. You don’t ever want to sound like you need the client. What Irene says is this sounds to me like a situation that we could both work on or that I could work on with you. However I don’t ask clients to make that decision at this moment. I would rather you give it some time and think about it, even 24 hrs. and if you should decide that you want to move forward here.. explain how that would happen.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Asking would you be interested in working together? Either is an option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you haven’t heard back in a few days, then it is appropriate to follow up with an email.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>You can also give your welcome packet here or at the intake session</b></li>
